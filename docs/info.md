## How it works

The Implies Gate in Discrete Mathematics / Digital Design can be described with this truth table:

| P | Q | P => Q |
|----------------|
| T | T |   T    |
| T | F |   F    |
| F | T |   T    |
| F | F |   T    |

where P and Q are prepositional binary-like variables.

This implies operation is done to each bit of "A" and "B", where "A" and "B" both represent 4 bit vectors, 
and returned as a resulting 4 bit "A => B" vector.

## How to test

Explain how to use your project

Hook up the first four strictly input IO pins to form your "A",
then hook up the next four strictly input IO pins to form your "B"

The strictly 4 output pins will be your resulting "A => B".

## External hardware

None external hardware is necessary
